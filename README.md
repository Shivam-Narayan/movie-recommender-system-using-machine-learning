# Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Movie Recommender System built using machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies based on user preferences and historical interactions, providing personalized recommendations.

## Features
- Content-based Filtering
- Collaborative Filtering (using matrix factorization)
- Hybrid Recommendation Models
- Interactive user interface for movie search and recommendations

## Dataset
The system uses publicly available movie datasets such as the [MovieLens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsanaseer/top-rated-tmdb-movies-10k?fbclid=IwAR2MpWrWpcw2QNCv_FZg2l0sjBh9xAvhrqtnZBO9K-QS6PHI1aHkdB6qLa0) which contains movie ratings, titles, genres, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivam-Narayan/movie-recommender-system-using-machine-learning.git
   cd movie-recommender-system-using-machine-learning
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Start the application and access the web interface.
- Search for movies by title.
- Get personalized recommendations based on your interactions.

## Recommendation Techniques

### Content-Based Filtering
- Uses movie metadata (e.g., genres, keywords) to recommend similar movies.

### Collaborative Filtering
- Implements matrix factorization techniques (such as Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) to recommend movies based on user interactions.

### Hybrid Model
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for enhanced recommendations.

## Example Output
```
Recommended Movies for User 123:
1. Inception (2010)
2. The Dark Knight (2008)
3. Interstellar (2014)
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for the web interface)
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
